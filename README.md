# Farm Profit Estimator

A data-driven full-stack web application that predicts farm profitability using historical agricultural cost and yield datasets.  
The platform allows users to input operational parameters and receive projected profit estimates through an integrated machine-learning prediction pipeline.

Built to demonstrate how machine learning models can be deployed as real-world decision-support systems through scalable APIs and interactive front-end interfaces
